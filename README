fourfours.pl attempts to solve the 'four fours' problem.

Try to make as many positive integers as you can, using only four
occurrences of the digit '4', and some mathematical symbols.
Quite how obscure symbols you are allowed can be controlled by
the command line switches, though note this increases run time.
You can also specify a different number of fours (COUNT) or
a different digit (DIGIT).

I do not claim that this perl is optimised or pretty.
